How about some advise we got to avoid getting banned?

1. Play the game in a steady pace.

2. Do not rush and spam click. You might get flagged for scripting

3. Don't click the map too fast
- split the traffic into 4 accounts at a time

4. You can play multiple account but to some extent. Do not play too much accounts!
- currently have 6 accounts (one contributor claimed that they get banned for having 10 accounts)

5. Do not leave your account open in the background for too long.
- implement rest_hour

And yeah, don't try to use cheats or scripts.

(Here's an example of what some members of the community thinks why people were banned)
